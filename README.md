This is a simple event event management system , to automate a college clubs and student chapters.

There will be many clubs and student chapter in a college , but to get notified by them is going to be a challenging task.

To overcome this problem , I  "Goutham reddy Uppunuri" came with a solution . 
Where a club or student chapter is given an account and they can send or post "events".

Services :
 -> for image upload a different server is used which is also implemented by me.
 --> other than media management every thing is inside this repository.
